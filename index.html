      <p><h1>Berlin's Tech Communities</h1></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="text-paragraph">
    <p>For those who take a programming path, community is key to both professional development and career success.
      While you’ll definitely find support, knowledge exchange, and discussions in online groups, <strong>offline communities</strong> can offer you two more ingredients of professional success:
      (1) face-to-face communication with fellow humans and (2) networking.
      And if you have relocated to a new city for work—in our case, to Berlin—these two will make your integration smoother and faster.</p>

    <p>
    This is exactly why we thought it’s worth to make a map of Berlin’s major tech events and list the local offline dev communities.
    Below, you’ll find a selection of some major <strong>offline</strong> technology communities, sites, groups, events, etc.:
      <ol>
        <li>Key tech conferences</li>
        <li>Popular get-together locations</li>
        <li>General tech communities</li>
        <li>Communities by technology</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> we have collected information only about those areas of tech on which our team specialises. If you didn’t find a group that's focused on your technology, please don’t take it personally.</p>

  <h2>1. Tech conferences and festivals</h2>

  <h2>4. Communities by technology</h2>

  <div class="text-paragraph">
    <p>Finally, there are specialised groups as well. In a big city like Berlin, pretty much every programming language (in case of JS, also its frameworks and libraries) has a sizable community of its own.
      What’s interesting, some of them can be even bigger than mixed communities (check out the Python Users Group, for example).</p>
